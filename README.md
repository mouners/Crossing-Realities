Description:

In a world where the skies are constantly monitored, danger lurks above, unseen by most—but not by Morgan Reed. As a seasoned State Sky Watcher, Morgan's daily routine is to ensure the safety of the airspace. But today, his role transforms from a distant guardian to a hands-on hero.

A distress call cuts through the static of his radio, a voice filled with fear and desperation. A stranger is trapped, their equipment failing, and their survival slipping away with every passing second. With no time to lose, Morgan must step beyond his usual duties, gathering the tools, equipment, and supplies necessary to launch a daring rescue mission.

The stakes are high, and the path is uncertain, but Morgan Reed knows one thing for sure—failure is not an option. The stranger’s life depends on his courage and resolve.

Skybound Rescue is a thrilling journey of quick thinking, resource gathering, and life-saving decisions. Will you guide Morgan to save the stranger in time, or will the skies claim another victim?
